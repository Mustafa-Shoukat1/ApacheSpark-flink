# Contributing to Apache Spark & Flink Production Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### 📋 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. **Implement** your changes following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested
4. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs
5. **Ensure** the test suite passes
6. **Submit** your pull request!

## 🎯 Code Review Process

- **All submissions** require review before merging
- **Maintainers** look for code quality, test coverage, and documentation
- **Feedback** will be provided within 48 hours
- **Two approvals** required for major changes

## 🐛 Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue with:

- **Summary** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Environment details** (OS, versions, etc.)
- **Logs and screenshots** if applicable

## ✨ Feature Requests

Open an issue with:
- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** and business value
- **Proposed implementation** approach
- **Acceptance criteria**

## 📝 Coding Standards

### 🐍 Python
```python
# Use type hints
def process_data(df: DataFrame, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> DataFrame:
    """Process data with given configuration."""
    pass

# Follow PEP 8
# Use docstrings for all functions
# Prefer composition over inheritance
```

### 🔥 Scala
```scala
// Use case classes for data
case class UserEvent(userId: String, eventType: String, timestamp: Long)

// Prefer immutable data structures
// Use meaningful variable names
// Add comprehensive error handling
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for external dependencies
- **End-to-end tests** for critical workflows
- **Performance tests** for optimization features
- **Minimum 90% code coverage**

## 📚 Documentation

- **API documentation** using docstrings
- **Architecture decisions** in ADR format
- **Runbooks** for operational procedures
- **Examples** for all major features
- **Keep README.md updated**
